# Battle-Of-The-Biomes-Game
This project is a simulation game written in C where various habitats engage in battles for survival, based on data read from an external veri.txt file. The game uses abstraction and simulation to model interactions between ecosystems, which compete for resources and adapt to changing environments. The battle continues until only one habitat remains. The project features a modular structure for easy understanding and modification, with the build process automated using a Makefile. The file structure is organized with separate directories for source files, headers, binaries, and documentation. The game's rules and detailed explanation can be found in the doc folder. To build and run the project, users can clone the repository, execute make to compile the code, and run the game from the bin folder...
